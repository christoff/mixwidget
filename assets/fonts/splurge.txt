ABOUT SPLURGE. . .Splurge was created by moi, l'Abécédarienne, in 1994. It contains a full set of accents and symbols (except scientific). It is based directly on my casual writing in Sharpie pen. It is a rough font, not fine-tuned for text; this is intended to retain a sense of handwriting. I recommend using Splurge at larger point sizes for short lines of text — and do avoid setting with it in all capital letters (blech). I later tuned it up a little and added a bold weight but... it was my first font and only an experiment, so don't expect much.ABOUT DISTRIBUTION. . .You may distribute this font shamelessly. You may translate it to any platform, just don't change name. You may remix it, just give me credit and let me know.BY THE WAY. . .The name Splurge was randomly generated by my finger falling into the pages of a dictionary.                                        V                                       { }                                      { . }                                     { . . }                     o o o o o o    { . . . }    o o o o o o                     ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ { . . . . } ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^                   |                                         |                   |          abc@abecedarienne.com          |                   |                                         |                   |          www.abecedarienne.com          |                   |                                         |                   o-----------------------------------------o
